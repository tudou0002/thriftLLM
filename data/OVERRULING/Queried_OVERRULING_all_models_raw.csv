Explanation: When a court ""disavows"" or ""disapproves"" language from a prior decision, it is effectively overruling that prior decision to the extent that it is inconsistent with the current opinion.

In the first example, the court is disavowing the language in the Sandoval decision that related to the sufficiency of the evidence, indicating that the prior decision is being overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with the current opinion.

In the second example, the court is simply quoting from a prior decision without making any statement about whether it is overruling or disavowing that decision. Therefore, it is not overruling the prior decision.

In the third example, the court is disapproving the Herzog decision to the extent that it is inconsistent with the current opinion, indicating that the prior decision is being overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with the current opinion.",Yes,Yes,Yes," Yes

In this context, the statement ""we disapprove Herzog to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion"" implies that the current opinion is overruling or setting aside the previous Herzog opinion due to inconsistencies. Therefore, the answer is Yes, it is overruling.",Yes, Yes, Yes

Overruling refers to the act of a court in a subsequent decision to declare that a previous decision was wrong and is no longer to be followed.

Question: Is it overruling?
Answer:",No,No,No,"No

(Note: This statement appears to be a citation to a brief or document, rather than a statement that is overruling a prior decision.)",Answer: No," No, it does not appear that the second or third statement is overruling a prior decision. The second statement is simply reporting the facts presented in the Napa Auto Parts case, and the third statement is citing the argument made by Appellant Risner on pages 18-19 of their brief.

Overruling refers to the act of a higher court declaring that a previous decision by a lower court or by the same court is no longer valid. It typically occurs when the higher court finds that the previous decision was incorrectly decided or based on faulty reasoning.

In the first statement, the court is explicitly stating that it is disavowing the language in a previous decision (Sandoval) because it only relates to the sufficiency of evidence. This is an example of overruling, as the court is declaring that the previous decision's language is no longer valid.

However, in the second and third statements, there is no indication that a previous decision is being overruled. Instead, the second statement is simply reporting the facts of a case, and the third statement is citing an argument made in a brief. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that these statements are overruling a prior decision.","No

The text only mentions a reference to an appellant named Risner and some page numbers, but it does not indicate any change in legal precedent or decision. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is overruling without additional context.",No, No, No

The statement specifically mentions that the case ""Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara"" is ""reversed,"" not ""overruled.""

",No,No," Answer: No

In this context, the term ""reversed"" indicates that a previous decision or ruling has been overturned or annulled, but it does not necessarily mean that a new decision is overruling it.

Overruling, on the other hand, typically involves a higher court setting aside its own previous decisions or those of a lower court to establish a new precedent. Since the context specifies that the case is ""reversed"" rather than ""overruled,"" it suggests that the decision is not establishing a new precedent that overrules previous decisions.
